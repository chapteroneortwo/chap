It read like a conversation with a bloke down the pub. Allen freely admits he has no scientific of medical background, but I expected at least some reference to basic nutrition facts. Instead his entire argument is that we need to eat more like "Mother Nature intended" and he refers constantly to the assumed eating habits of various animals (elephants, guerillas and termites seem to be favourites).<br/> <br/> I skimmed the second half, looking for a chapter or collection of bullet points outlining his method, and found only more animal comparisons and a few irrelevant details.<br/> <br/> Things like advising to just eat fruit for breakfast will help a person lose weight if they are currently eating sugary breakfast cereals, or calorie-dense fry-ups, because three pieces of fruit represent less than 30% the calories!

This is another fad diet, with its rules and guidelines based on unscientific assumptions presented with condescending rhetoric. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 16 people found this helpful</span> <span> <span> Helpful </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <i> </i> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> Amazon verified</span> <i> <span> 5.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> AWESOME</span> <span> Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 April 2018</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> In this book there is s Margin level to bypass some of the suggestion so you don’t need to become vegan.

His way of writing must trigger something hypnotic in my brain as it works for me. The key is to read over & over again and not put pressure on yourself to do anything too soon.. l still refer to it occasionally. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 29 people found this helpful</span> <span> <span> Helpful </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <i> </i> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> Literate Hamster</span> <i> <span> 1.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> Cannot recommend</span> <span> Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 October 2018</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> If you’re impressed with his technique with respect to stopping smoking then you’re going to br be very disappointed with this. The difference, I believe, is that smoking is not necessary to life whereas eating food is. The book degenerates into some scientifically unproven dieting guidelines. If these cause you to be more mindful of what you’re eating and consequently more moderate in your intake then this book may help you, but there are many better and genuinely more helpful books about losing weight on the market. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 12 people found this helpful</span> <span> <span> Helpful </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <i> </i> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> Kindle Customer</span> <i> <span> 1.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> Sorry, I found this book to be boring, as if the author intended it to change the reader into a vegetarian. To make me discussed at myself for eating animals. I don't believe we have the inclination or the time, to indulge in eating plantation like the gorillas. I bought and read Allen Carr's Easyway to control your drinking, and it was a revelation and a " miracle" for me as I have stopped drinking now for 2 weeks, starting from the 1st of December. I intend to continue on over Christmas and New year, visiting family who will be drinking alcohol. I'm almost 70 years old, and feel i have been given a new start in life (better late than never) This book i would highly recommend!!!</span> <span> Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 December 2018</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> Sorry, I found this book to be boring, as if the author digressed from the reason i bought the book ( to help me lose weight) to trying to convert me to vegetarism. I bought "Easy way to control your drinking" marvellous book, really works. I'm almost 70 haven't had a drink in 18days, starting from the 1st. December. Going into the" party season" and visiting family who "enjoy" a drink, I know that I can continue to remain sober because of the Easyway. Thanks for that, it goes to show, your never too old to learn. Please if you've had the same problem as me, give yourself the greatest gift you can for yourself and your family and buy the book. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 10 people found this helpful</span> <span> <span> Helpful </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <i> </i> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> anapal</span> <i> <span> 5.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> It works, I've lost weight!</span> <span> Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 August 2015</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> I found this book very annoying at times BUT I have lost 16 kg (2,5 stones) and still losing.

The value of fruit not only to aid dugestion but also to wean you off processed sweet stuff. Fruit really is far more delicious if you give it a proper chance.<br/> <br/> 2. Food combining. This is not new and is otherwise known as the Hay Diet. It's explained much better by others. It's about eating different types of food (protien/carbohydrate/ fruit) separately with an appropriate gap to allow digestion. It really works to reduce upset tummy issues, discomfort and you will lose weight if only because of the care you're taking about what you're eating. It's not an original idea of Allen's though. It worked brilliantly for me in the past and having been reminded of it, I cant wait to do it again !<br/> <br/> The things I didn't like about this book are all those mentioned elsewhere plus the god / creationist stuff. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 2 people found this helpful</span> <span> <span> Helpful </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <i> </i> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> The Seeker</span> <i> <span> 4.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> Rather misleading, but contains a lot of truths!</span> <span> Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 May 2021</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> So basically you can eat as much as you want of whatever you like .so long as it's fruit, nuts and seeds. And if you don't like these, then you train yourself to like them, because they are what nature intended us to eat. I would agree in principle that these are the foods that are good for us, but the book is misleading when it keeps reiterating that we can eat as much as we want of whatever we like. It clearly isn't true. The book is also padded out with a lot of waffle, repeated, and some rather strange analogies. It's also written in quite an amateurish style. However, in spite of these criticisms, I agree with the principles, there is a lot of truth in his ideas, and I have found it useful to refer to from time to time when I find myself sliding into bad habits. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> <span> Helpful </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <i> </i> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> See all reviews </span> <span> </span> <br/> Your recently viewed items and featured recommendations &#8250; View or edit your browsing history <span> After viewing product detail pages, look here to find an easy way to navigate back to pages you are interested in.</span> <br/> <span> Back to top </span> Get to Know Us Careers About Us UK Modern Slavery Statement Sustainability Make Money with Us Sell on Amazon Sell on Amazon Business Sell on Amazon Handmade Sell on Amazon Launchpad Associates Programme Fulfilment by Amazon Seller Fulfilled Prime Advertise Your Products Independently Publish with Us Amazon Pay Host an Amazon Hub <span> ›</span> See all Amazon Payment Methods Amazon Platinum Mastercard Amazon Classic Mastercard Amazon Money Store Gift Cards Amazon Currency Converter Payment Methods Help Shop with Points Top Up Your Account Top Up Your Account in Store Let Us Help You COVID-19 and Amazon Track Packages or View Orders Delivery Rates & Policies Amazon Prime Returns & Replacements Recycling Manage Your Content and Devices Amazon Mobile App Amazon Assistant Customer Service Australia Brazil Canada China France Germany India Italy Japan Mexico Netherlands Poland Singapore Spain Turkey United Arab Emirates United States Amazon Music<br> <span> Stream millions<br> of songs</span> AbeBooks<br> <span> Books, art<br> & collectables</span> ACX<br> <span> Audiobook Publishing<br> Made Easy</span> Amazon Web Services<br> <span> Scalable Cloud<br> Computing Services</span> Audible<br> <span> Download Audiobooks</span> Book Depository<br> <span> Books With Free<br> Delivery Worldwide</span> DPReview<br> <span> Digital<br> Photography</span> Goodreads<br> <span> Book reviews<br> & recommendations</span> Amazon Home Services<br> <span> Experienced pros<br> Happiness Guarantee</span> IMDb<br> <span> Movies, TV<br> & Celebrities</span> Kindle Direct Publishing<br> <span> Indie Digital & Print Publishing<br> Made Easy</span> Shopbop<br> <span> Designer<br> Fashion Brands</span> Amazon Warehouse<br> <span> Deep Discounts<br> Open-Box Products</span> Amazon Business<br> <span> Service for<br> business customers</span> Whole Foods Market<br> <span> We Believe in<br> Real Food</span> Amazon Second Chance<br> <span> Pass it on, trade it in,<br> give it a second life</span> Conditions of Use & Sale Privacy Notice Cookies Notice Interest-Based Ads Notice <span> &copy; 1996-2021, Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates</span>

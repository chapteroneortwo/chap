In 1983, after countless failed attempts to quit, he went from 100 cigarettes a day to zero without suffering withdrawal pangs, without using willpower and without gaining weight. He realised that he had discovered what the world had been waiting for - the Easy Way to Stop Smoking - and embarked on a mission to help cure the world's smokers. <br> <br> Easyway has grown to become a global phenomenon with seminar centres in 150+ cities in more than 50 countries around the world. Allen Carr's Easyway books, online video programmes, and live group seminars have helped an estimated 50 million smokers worldwide. A vast majority of those happy non-smokers became aware of the method as a result of personal recommendation from their friends, family, and colleagues. <br> <br> Allen Carr is now recognised as the world's leading expert on helping smokers to quit and has sold over 16 million books on the topic. His Easyway method has been successfully applied to a host of issues including weight control, alcohol and other addictions and fears. In 2006, Allen was diagnosed with lung cancer and passed away that November handing responsibility for Easyway over to his closest and most trusted colleagues.</p> <h2> Product details</h2> <span> </span> <span> <span> Publisher &rlm; : &lrm; </span> <span> Arcturus; Pap/Com edition (August 15, 2014)</span> </span> <span> <span> Language &rlm; : &lrm; </span> <span> English</span> </span> <span> <span> Paperback &rlm; : &lrm; </span> <span> 256 pages</span> </span> <span> <span> ISBN-10 &rlm; : &lrm; </span> <span> 1784044954</span> </span> <span> <span> ISBN-13 &rlm; : &lrm; </span> <span> 978-1784044954</span> </span> <span> <span> Item Weight &rlm; : &lrm; </span> <span> 11.5 ounces</span> </span> <span> <span> Dimensions &rlm; : &lrm; </span> <span> 6 x 0.75 x 8.75 inches</span> </span> <span> <span> Best Sellers Rank: </span> #77,372 in Books ( See Top 100 in Books ) <span> #16 in Hypnosis for Diets </span> <span> #32 in Homeopathy Medicine </span> <span> #801 in Weight Loss Diets (Books) </span> </span> <span> <span> Customer Reviews: </span> <span> <span> <span> <i> <span> 3.9 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <i> </i> </span> <span> </span> </span> </span> <span> </span> <span> <span> 314 ratings</span> </span> </span> <h2> Videos</h2> <span> <span> Page <span> 1</span> of <span> 1</span> </span> <span> <span> </span> Start Over </span> <span> Page 1 of 1</span> </span> <span> <i> <span> Previous page</span> </i> </span> <h4> Videos for this product</h4> <p> 1:50 </p> <p> Click to play video </p> <h4> How to Lose Weight in a Healthy Way </h4> <span> eHow</span> <span> <i> <span> Next page</span> </i> </span> <span> <span> Upload your video<i> </i> </span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> Customer Review: </span> <span> How to Lose Weight in a Healthy Way</span> <span> See full review</span> eHow <span> Onsite Associates Program </span> <span> Amazon Influencer </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <h2> Customer reviews</h2> <i> <span> 3.9 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> <span> 3.9 out of 5</span> </span> <span> 314 global ratings</span> <span> <span> <span> 5 star </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 53% </span> <span> 4 star </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 13% </span> <span> 3 star </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 14% </span> <span> 2 star </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 10% </span> <span> 1 star </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 10% </span> </span> <i> </i> <span> How are ratings calculated?</span> To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average.

Those who are dismissing or simplifying the book down to &#34;become a vegan&#34; are missing the greater point that there are certain foods our bodies are designed to digest, and we should eat more of those foods, and less of foods that we are not designed to handle. I read the book in a few hours over this past weekend, and listened to the audio CD at the end. For the past week, I have been eating much better, and every time I see (or smell) some food which in the past would have been trouble (for me it was primarily sugar / candy) I come to the decision that I don't want it. Reading the book has helped me want to eat better, and after a week I have, and I also feel tremendous.<br/> <br/> Of course, with any type of weight loss system, or program long term results are most important, and time will tell if this continues to work for me. Still, I'd recommend the book and say it's worth a shot if you can go into it with an open mind.<br/> <br/> Coming back one month later to post an update. It's still working, and I'm down about 35 lbs so far. My meat consumption has gone down significantly but I haven't cut it out completely (now I eat 2-3 small portions per week.) . My non-fruit sugar consumption is also way down, almost completely cut out. And the best part is, I don't really feel like I'm missing these things, I'm happy to eat fruit, vegetables and nuts, and feeling hungry before dinner has become a good thing!<br/> <br/> Three Month Update - I am down almost 60 lbs, fairly close to my target weight. I just ran my first 5k, and started running regularly, not to lose weight, but because I am enjoying it. Try this book! </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 173 people found this helpful</span> <span> <span> Helpful </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <i> </i> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> just some dude</span> <i> <span> 2.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> Reads like an outline for several future books</span> <span> Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2017</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> This book is different from Allen Carr's other motivational books, in both interesting and confusing ways. The goal of it is to get you to eat what you want, as much as you want, when you want, without any diets, and still lose weight. By following Nature's Guide - a psuedo-vegan diet. Other reviewers point out the contradiction between those two sentences, but that is the clever way Allen Carr is trying to modify our eating choices. Eat what you want - but do you really want sugar and meat? As much as you want - but do you really need to eat that much?<br/> <br/> While that is clever and interesting, overall this book is by far the most conventional in its advice of all the Carr books I have read. I have heard many of these same arguments from nutritionist and other diet experts. And that is also why I can't write that I liked this book. It is way too scattershot and doesn't linger on any particular aspect of diet for long enough for any of it to sink in. If he had just focused on stopping sugar consumption, that would have been a far better book, because he does have a lot of interesting things to say about that particular topic, and that would go along way to getting weight under control for many. Instead it leaps off into arguments targeting meat eating, the dangers of dairy products and for a book that is supposed to be about losing weight, meat and dairy products can be consumed quite easily and safely while maintaining a healthy weight. So the overall effect is that it emulates the &#34;sweeping change&#34; strategy that makes so many people fail at dieting, while also condemning the idea of diets itself throughout the book. And he does allow for a &#34;junk margin&#34; that makes it so you can still eat all of these things he just made arguments against, so that also further muddles the focus.<br/> <br/> Allen Carr often gets dinged in reviews for the repetition of his arguments, but I always thought that was a good counter-brainwashing tactic to emphasize how faulty the reader's thinking is a topic and burn it into the brain that the answer is not an addiction. It worked, too - his quit smoking book has me without a cigarette for three years now. But in contrast, this book casts such a wide net in its stated goal that it doesn't ever gain any steam on any one track, and ended up overwhelming me.<br/> <br/> In short, I don't think the Allen Carr method works to get you to change something, as much as it does to get you to stop something. Stopping something dangerous and stupid is very easy to do, but no one can stop eating. It might have worked in a more targeted and focused book against sugar, but as an all-encompassing diet change, it doesn't work at all. I am three weeks in on his &#34;Quit Drinking&#34; book (which is great) and I am hoping that by quitting alcohol I will have solved most of my weight problems. This book, I gave it a try, but it just isn't doing it for me. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 44 people found this helpful</span> <span> <span> Helpful </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <i> </i> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> Augiesez</span> <i> <span> 2.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> You can eat anything you want as long and you become a vegetarian!

It felt like a bad Amway presentation that takes and hour and a half to spring the bad news on you. It is packed with bad nutritional advice that is debunked by all the keto and paleo research. I read this because of the glowing review of other Allen Carr book on giving up alcohol but this was a real disappointment. If I wanted to be a skinny, lifeless vegan I'd revisit my childhood when I was given no choice. I picture the listless vegans trying to feign enjoyment of their greens with lemon juice, yuck! Now I enjoy meats and fats of all kinds, if it's cute in the field it's even tastier on the tongue (I'm looking at you, Mr. adorable Lamb!). Sure it sucks to kill stuff for fun but kill to grill?

So, if you want to lose all the weight because you can't absorb anything and you are gassy all the time. Do this. If you want to actually feel great (even after 10 years) drop the ingredist stuff and eat meat, eggs, and diary (if you can handle dairy). You won't have to eat very much, many times, or much at all since all three have super high bioavailability unlike his recommendations. Right now I have lost 60 pounds and I eat once or twice a day and until I am full. So, good instructions, he is just wrong about meat and diary. Also, he said there were bad things about it and science disagrees with him, so do hunter/gather tribes. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 14 people found this helpful</span> <span> <span> Helpful </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <i> </i> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> See all reviews </span> <span> <span> <h3> Top reviews from other countries </h3> <span> Sue</span> <i> <span> 5.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> <span> Life changing!</span> </span> <span> Reviewed in the United Kingdom on January 19, 2019</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> I read this book after it was recommended to me. Allen Carr suggests to read the book with an open mind, so I did, I actually read the whole book in one day. I have never looked back! I now only desire to eat fresh food from Mother Nature, I don’t even see manufactured food as food! I don’t have any cravings for these foods any more, I am free of my sugar addiction too. All I enjoy eating is fruit, veg, pulses, nuts, seeds etc etc. I never use to crave an apple! I do now 😄, fruit was at the bottom of my food pile, now it’s at the top. This book has changed my life, I am<br/> Loosing weight naturally, I am never hungry and I really enjoy eating like I did before but now it’s natural foods. I have so much more energy as well. Life changing - read the book with an open mind and I hope it changes others lives like it has mine! </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 16 people found this helpful</span> </span> <span> <span> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> Simon C</span> <i> <span> 4.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> <span> Another weight loss book!</span> </span> <span> Reviewed in the United Kingdom on September 24, 2019</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> Good book.
